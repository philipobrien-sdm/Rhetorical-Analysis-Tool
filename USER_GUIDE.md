# Rhetorical Analysis AI - User Guide

## 1. Welcome! What is this Tool?

Welcome to the Rhetorical Analysis AI! This tool is like a pair of X-ray glasses for any text. It's designed to help you look "under the hood" of an article, speech, or even a conversation to see *how* it's trying to persuade you.

Instead of just telling you what a text says, this tool shows you the hidden machinery: the persuasive techniques, the emotional appeals, and the logical arguments (or flaws!) that are working to influence your opinion. The goal is to help you become a more critical reader and a more aware consumer of information.

## 2. Getting Started: Analyzing Your First Text

There are two easy ways to get started.

### Option A: As a Browser Extension (Recommended)

1.  Navigate to any webpage with an article you want to analyze.
2.  Click the **"Analyze Current Page"** button at the top of the tool's interface.
3.  The tool will automatically pull the text from the page into the text box. It's that simple!

### Option B: Paste Text Manually

1.  Copy any text you want to analyze (it needs to be at least 200 characters long).
2.  Paste it directly into the large text area.
3.  Give your analysis a **Title** (this is optional, but it helps find it in your history later).

Once your text is ready, click **"Run Generic Analysis"**.

## 3. Understanding the Report

After a few moments, your detailed report will appear. It's organized into tabs to help you explore.

### The Different "Lenses" (Tabs)

*   **Detailed Analysis:** This is the expert view. It gives you the full, in-depth breakdown of the thesis, key claims, techniques, and logical fallacies, complete with "Rhetorical Heat" scores.
*   **For Students:** A simplified view that explains the core ideas and techniques in an engaging, easy-to-understand way. Perfect for younger learners!
*   **Plain Language:** This tab translates the expert analysis into simple, direct language for the average adult reader, cutting through the jargon.
*   **Neurodivergent-Friendly:** This special view is designed for clarity. It uses very literal language and explicitly explains any unspoken social cues, idioms, or non-literal phrases, making the subtext of the conversation visible.
*   **Sculpt & Rewrite:** This isn't for analysis, but for creation! Here you can rewrite the original text with a new tone (see Advanced Features below).

### Special Feature: Conversation Heatmap

If you analyze a conversation (like a chat or a script), you won't see the tabs. Instead, you'll get a **Conversation Heatmap**. This color-codes the dialogue from cool blue (low intensity) to hot red (high intensity), showing you exactly where the key moments of persuasion, emotion, or conflict happen.

## 4. Advanced Features

### Sculpt & Rewrite: Become the Author

This powerful tab lets you play with the text.
*   **For Articles:** You'll see sliders for things like "Professionalism" and "Emotionality." Adjust them and click **"Rewrite Text"** to see the AI generate a new version with the tone you've chosen.
*   **For Conversations:** You'll see a box asking for a "what if" scenario. Try typing something like, "What if the first speaker was more nervous?" and click **"Rewrite Conversation"** to see how the dialogue changes.

### Personalize Your Analysis (Optional)

This is a powerful feature for self-reflection.
1.  Click on the **"Personalize Analysis (Optional)"** dropdown.
2.  Fill in any of the fields you're comfortable with (e.g., your age, nationality, worldview).
3.  Click **"Save Profile"**. This data is **saved only in your browser**.
4.  Now, you can click the **"Run Personalized Analysis"** button. The report will include a new section in the "Detailed Analysis" tab with feedback on how the text's rhetoric might specifically relate to your background.

## 5. Managing Your History

Every analysis you run is automatically saved.
*   Click on the **"Analysis History"** dropdown to see your past reports.
*   You can **Load**, **Rename**, or **Delete** any entry.

## 6. Exporting and Debugging

At the bottom of every report, you'll find some useful buttons:
*   **Export to HTML:** Saves a complete, interactive copy of your report to your computer.
*   **View Raw JSON:** For the curious! This shows you the raw data the AI sent back.

## 7. Very Important Reminders!

*   **This tool is NOT a fact-checker.** It analyzes *how* something is said, not *if* it's true. Always verify claims from other sources.
*   **The AI is not perfect.** It's incredibly smart, but it can miss things or misinterpret nuance. Use its report as a starting point for your own thinking, not as a final verdict.
*   **You are the final judge.** The goal of this tool is to empower your critical thinking, not replace it.

Happy analyzing!
