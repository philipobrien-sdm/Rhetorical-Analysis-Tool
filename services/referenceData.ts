  {
    name: 'Metaphor',
    detailed: 'A figure of speech in which a word or phrase is applied to an object or action to which it is not literally applicable, suggesting a resemblance.',
    plain: 'Comparing two different things by saying one IS the other. It’s a direct comparison, like "Her voice is music to my ears."',
    student: 'It’s like saying something is another thing to make a point, even though it’s not literally true. For example, "The classroom was a zoo!" doesn\'t mean there were animals, just that it was wild and noisy.'
  },
  {
    name: 'Simile',
    detailed: 'A figure of speech involving the comparison of one thing with another thing of a different kind, used to make a description more emphatic or vivid (e.g., as brave as a lion). Uses "like" or "as".',
    plain: 'Comparing two things using the words "like" or "as". For example, "He is as strong as an ox" or "She sings like an angel."',
    student: 'It\'s when you say something is LIKE something else. You\'ll almost always see the words "like" or "as." For example, "He runs as fast as the wind" or "Her smile was like sunshine."'
  },
  {
    name: 'Alliteration',
    detailed: 'The occurrence of the same letter or sound at the beginning of adjacent or closely connected words.',
    plain: 'Repeating the same starting sound in a group of words. For example, "Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled peppers."',
    student: 'It\'s when words that are close together start with the same sound. Think of tongue twisters like "She sells seashells by the seashore." It makes sentences sound catchy.'
  },
  {
    name: 'Personification',
    detailed: 'The attribution of a personal nature or human characteristics to something nonhuman, or the representation of an abstract quality in human form.',
    plain: 'Giving human qualities or actions to inanimate objects or animals. For instance, "The wind whispered through the trees."',
    student: 'This is when you give human powers to things that aren\'t human. Like if you say, "The sun smiled down on us" or "My computer is refusing to work today." Computers can\'t refuse, but it sounds like it has a personality.'
  },
  {
    name: 'Hyperbole',
    detailed: 'Exaggerated statements or claims not meant to be taken literally, used for emphasis or effect.',
    plain: 'A massive exaggeration to make a point. For example, "I\'m so hungry I could eat a horse" or "I’ve told you a million times."',
    student: 'It\'s a super-duper big exaggeration to show strong feeling. Like when you say "I have a ton of homework" or "This is taking forever!" You don\'t really have 2,000 pounds of homework, you just have a lot.'
  },
  {
    name: 'Rhetorical Question',
    detailed: 'A question asked in order to create a dramatic effect or to make a point rather than to get an answer.',
    plain: 'Asking a question where you don\'t actually expect an answer. It\'s used to make the audience think or to emphasize a point. "Are you kidding me?" is a common one.',
    student: 'It’s asking a question that you don\'t really want an answer to. It’s just a way to make people think. Like if your room is messy and your parent says, "Are you ever going to clean this up?" They aren\'t really asking, they\'re telling you to clean it.'
  },
  {
    name: 'Anaphora',
    detailed: 'The repetition of a word or phrase at the beginning of successive clauses.',
    plain: 'Repeating the same word or phrase at the start of several sentences or clauses in a row. It creates a strong rhythm and emphasizes the repeated phrase. Martin Luther King Jr.\'s "I have a dream..." speech is a famous example.',
    student: 'This is when a writer or speaker starts a bunch of sentences in a row with the same words. It makes the idea really stick in your head. Like, "We will fight. We will win. We will celebrate."'

  {
    name: 'Ad Hominem',
    detailed: 'An argument that is directed against a person rather than the position they are maintaining. It attacks the opponent\'s character or personal traits in an attempt to undermine their argument.',
    plain: 'Attacking the person making the argument instead of the argument itself. For example, "You can\'t trust his opinion on the economy, he can\'t even dress himself properly."',
    student: 'This is a personal attack. Instead of arguing about the topic (like video games), you say something mean about the person, like "You don\'t know anything about video games, you\'re just a little kid!" It\'s a way to avoid the real argument.'
  },
  {
    name: 'Straw Man',
    detailed: 'Substituting a person\'s actual position or argument with a distorted, exaggerated, or misrepresented version of the position of the argument.',
    plain: 'Misrepresenting someone\'s argument to make it easier to attack. For example, if someone says "We should invest more in education," a straw man response would be "So you want to throw unlimited money at schools and bankrupt the country?"',
    student: 'This is when you pretend someone said something they didn\'t, because the fake argument is easier to beat. If your friend says, "I think we should eat more fruit," and you say, "So you think we should NEVER eat candy again?!" you just made a straw man. Your friend never said that.'
  },
  {
    name: 'False Dilemma / False Dichotomy',
    detailed: 'A fallacy in which a speaker presents only two choices or outcomes as the only possible options, when in fact more possibilities exist.',
    plain: 'Presenting a situation as if there are only two choices, when in reality there are more. It\'s an "either/or" trap, like saying "You\'re either with us or against us."',
    student: 'This is when someone tries to trick you by saying there are only two choices, but there are actually more. Like saying, "You can either clean your room now or be grounded for a month." There are probably other options, like cleaning it after dinner.'
  },
  {
    name: 'Slippery Slope',
    detailed: 'An argument that suggests taking a minor action will lead to major and sometimes ludicrous consequences.',
    plain: 'Arguing that a small first step will inevitably lead to a chain of related, negative events. For example: "If we let kids have phones in class, next they\'ll be watching movies, and soon no one will learn anything at all."',
    student: 'This is a wild exaggeration where you say if one small thing happens, a bunch of crazy, terrible things will happen next. "If you don\'t do your homework, you\'ll fail the class, then you won\'t graduate, and you\'ll never get a job!" It\'s usually not that extreme.'
  },
  {
    name: 'Appeal to Authority',
    detailed: 'Insisting that a claim is true simply because a valid authority or expert on the issue said it was true, without any other supporting evidence offered.',
    plain: 'Saying something must be true because an expert or famous person said it. Just because they\'re an expert in one thing doesn\'t mean they\'re right about everything, especially if they have no evidence.',
    student: 'This is when you say, "Well, my dad said it, so it must be true!" Even if your dad is super smart, he might be wrong. You have to check the facts for yourself, not just believe someone because they\'re important.'
  },
  {
    name: 'Bandwagon',
    detailed: 'An argument that concludes a proposition must be true because many or most people believe it; it alleges, "If many believe so, it is so."',
    plain: 'Claiming that something is right or good simply because it\'s popular. "Everyone is buying this new phone, so it must be the best one." Popularity doesn\'t guarantee quality.',
    student: 'This is the "everyone is doing it" argument. Like if you say, "I should be able to stay up late, all my friends do!" Just because a lot of people are doing something doesn\'t automatically make it the right thing to do.'
  },
  {
    name: 'Hasty Generalization',
    detailed: 'A fallacy in which a conclusion is not logically justified by sufficient or unbiased evidence. It involves making a conclusion based on a small sample size.',
    plain: 'Jumping to a conclusion based on very little evidence. If you meet one rude person from a certain town, and you conclude everyone from that town is rude, that\'s a hasty generalization.',
    student: 'This is like judging a whole bag of candy based on the first piece you eat. If the first one is sour, you might say, "All of this candy is sour!" but you don\'t know that for sure until you\'ve tried more.'
